# Introduction

<p align="center"><img src="logo.png"><p>

> Do you know a version of [Github Profile Trophy (ryo-ma)](https://github.com/ryo-ma/github-profile-trophy)

So, this version will allow you to show all secret trophies instead of hiding them. [Rank Systems](#rank-systems)

It also reduces their difficulty so you can easily set a nicer profile! [Change logs](#change-logs)

Moreover, in this file, some modifications and improvements are added! [Change logs](#change-logs)

## Self-modify

You'll have to deploy yourself, for [Vercel](/VercelDeployGuide.md) or [localhost](/LocalDeployGuide.md)

If you want to configure which trophies you automatically get, configure these booleans in [src/trophy.ts at line 13](/src/trophy.ts#L13)

```ts
let wantAchieveSuperRank = false;
let wantMultipleLang = true;
let wantLongTimeAccount = true;
let wantAncientAccount = false;
let wantNewAccount = false;
let wantMultipleOrganizations = true;
```
